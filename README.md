# Connecteur-SPO

Dear Contributors Safae, Imrane, here are some explanations to start with:

### Prerequisites

- **Docker:** [Installation Guide](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)
- **Git:** [Installation Guide](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git)

### Setup and Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**
    ```sh
    git clone [Repository URL]
    cd [Repository Directory]
    ```

2. **Run with Docker**
    - Using Docker Compose:
        ```sh
        docker-compose up --build
        ```

3. **Setting Up Postman**

   - Open the file of APIs sent, then change the start of URLs to: `http://localhost:5000`. 
   For example: `http://localhost:5000/connecteur/modificationLot`, and then send a request.
  
   Visit `http://localhost:3000` in your browser and you should see the API information.

### Upcoming Modifications 

For any upcoming modifications, we recommend creating branches for each feature or modification. Then, push the code with a commit explaining the modifications. In this way, we will stay well-organized and protect our main code.

With love <3 from Khaoula ^^
